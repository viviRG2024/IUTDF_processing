# IUTFD: Integrated Urban Traffic Flow & Weather Data Framework

A comprehensive framework for processing and analyzing the relationship between urban traffic flow and weather data, with a particular focus on rainfall. This project provides a complete workflow from data collection and processing to analysis and visualization, helping researchers understand how rainfall impacts urban traffic patterns.

## Project Overview

Urban traffic flow is influenced by various factors, with weather conditions (especially rainfall) being an important but often underestimated variable. This framework integrates:

- City road network data
- Real-time traffic sensor data 
- High-precision rainfall and weather data

Through the integration and analysis of these datasets, the complex relationships between rainfall intensity, timing, and traffic flow can be revealed, providing scientific basis for urban traffic management and planning.

## Dataset Availability

This dataset includes urban traffic flow data combined with weather observations, with a particular emphasis on rainfall conditions. If you encounter any issues, feel free to raise an issue in this repository.

## Key Features

### Data Acquisition & Processing
- Retrieve and process city road network data
- Collect traffic sensor data
- Obtain and process ERA5 weather and rainfall data
- Data format conversion (CSV, Parquet, GeoJSON, NPZ)

### Data Integration
- Attach sensors to road networks
- Integrate weather data with road networks
- Calculate hourly sensor data
- Generate standardized metadata

### Visualization & Analysis
- Time series and spatial rainfall data visualization
- Comparative analysis of traffic flow on rainy versus dry days
- Analysis of rainfall intensity impact on traffic
- Analysis of traffic changes before and after rainfall (3-hour offset)
